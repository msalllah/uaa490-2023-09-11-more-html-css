        <h2>An H2 Header</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Let's look at a simple example. If we wanted to make the first paragraph in an article larger and bold,
                we could add a class to that paragraph and then add CSS to that class
            </p>

                A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first
                element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you
                had applied a class to some part of your document, often helping you cut down on excess classes in your
                markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.
